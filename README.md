# PySee
**PySee** is an electron-built python version manager.

## How it works?
This desktop application (for the moment) is MacOS only. To find all the python related stuff it executes some shell commands and parse data to display on the app.

## Getting Started
To setup and start the application:
```bash
$ cd PySee-master
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Coming Soon...
PySee will automatically check for other python versions downloaded with Anaconda and so on. The goal for this Electron app is also to uninstall python versions  directly from the app using UI.
